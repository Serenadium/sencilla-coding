# sencilla-coding
A coding platform to simplify coding in C#.

Bio:
Hi! I'm Eli, and I created Sencilla coding. Sencilla is a simple way to get introduced into coding, and even a permanent replacement for it! The platform is envisioned as a cross 
between Scratch and C#. I started coding in Scratch, and it was great, but after I got quite advanced there was an obvious limitation. Its speed. It was so slow for anything that 
did any type of large computations. But, it was the only language I was comfortable using. I tried getting into C# with some success, but there were clear disadvantages. In 
scratch, every single line of code, or "block" was on the side of the screen. And there weren't too many of them. In C#, there are so many different types of lines of code, and no 
easy way to remember them. I decided that a great idea was to create a sort of hybrid. The program would have an easy to use visual scripting platform that anyone could use, but 
would be efficiently built around the C# programming language, and could export into a normal script that would be indistinguishable from normally programmed C#.

I hope you'll consider helping out with the code, since, as I said, I'm not the greatest at normal coding, and then we may have a working beta!
